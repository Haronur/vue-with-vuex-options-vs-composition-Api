# Vuex Basics in Vue 3 with Composition API  (vue-with-vuex-options-vs-composition)
Today we will be creating a simple counter app from scratch to learn the basics of using Vuex 4 with Vue 3 Composition API. We'll start by taking a look at Vuex concepts like state, getters, and mutations and how to use them within the options API, then we will switch over the compositions API and implement the same functionality. We'll also create some reusable helper functions to make accessing the store in the composition API more readable.
